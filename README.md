# BitcoinWalletAddress
I designed these small programs as a demo programs that was showcased at Strathmore University, in Nairobi, Kenya, as part of bootcamp organised by the organisation I was interning for; BitHub Africa. The final program of this series of programs is a bitcoin wallet generator that generate a fully hashed bitcoin wallet address, just like the ones many crypto users use to transact.
