# BitcoinWalletAddress
I designed these small programs as demo programs that were showcased at Strathmore University, in Nairobi, Kenya, as part of bootcamp organised by the organisation I was interning for; BitHub Africa. The programs showcase different concepts applied in blockchain technology such as, elliptic curves, finite fields, public & private keys. The final program of this series of programs is a bitcoin wallet generator that generate a fully hashed bitcoin wallet address, just like the ones many crypto users use to transact.

The program is coded in java, and is using bitcoinj libraries used to create classes
